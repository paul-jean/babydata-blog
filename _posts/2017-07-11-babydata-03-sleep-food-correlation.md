Previously I plotted Toby\[CloseCurlyQuote]s bottle feedings over time in a diurnal plot:

We\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve wondered if the amount Toby eats at night (12 AM to 5 AM) is at all related to the amount he has eaten during the previous day (5 AM to 12 AM the previous day). Or more specifically, whether it depends on the amount he ate at his last feeding of the day around 6 PM. We thought he might be \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]filling up the tank\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] to get him through the night in his last feeding at 6 PM, and if he didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t eat enough he would wake up sooner at night because he runs out of calories. But we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve also read that his sleep isn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t really influenced by how much he ate in his last feeding (after about 6 weeks of age).

Last feeding of each day:

![babydata-03-sleep-food-correlation_16.gif](../../../assets/2017/07/11/babydata-03-sleep-food-correlation-600px/babydata-03-sleep-food-correlation_16.gif)

The amount Toby drank in the last bottle of the day has steadily increased. This is related to us getting him on a schedule of eating every 4 hours. He\[CloseCurlyQuote]s learned to drink more at each bottle to get him through to the next bottle 4 hours later.

Now find the time to first wake-up after the last bottle of the day. In other words, time from the last bottle of day n to first bottle of day n+1 ....

The number of hours between the last feeding of the day and the first feeding of the morning has steadily increased as Toby has grown over the first few months of his life.

Now find the amount he ate in his last bottle of the day together with the length of time he slept until his first bottle the next morning ....

On the surface it looks like the length of time Toby sleeps from his last bottle of the day to his first bottle the next morning is positively correlated with the amount he eats in his last bottle. BUT I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve just seen that both of these variables are each independently trending upwards over time. So there is a confounder variable here. Both time slept and amount eaten are positively correlated to Toby\[CloseCurlyQuote]s age. So how do I control for Toby\[CloseCurlyQuote]s age when testing the correlation?

It seems like I need to normalize each quantity by Toby\[CloseCurlyQuote]s age.

Controlling for the confounding influence of Toby\[CloseCurlyQuote]s age makes the correlation much less pronounced, if it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s there at all.
